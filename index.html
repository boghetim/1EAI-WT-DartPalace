<p1>The Recreational Darter</p1>
<br>
<pre>
	<p2>
	The recreational darter enjoys throwing a dart, but is not serious about darts.
	He enjoys the occasional dart with family or friends, but has no ambition to play darts more seriously.
	For the Recreational darter, brass darts, nickel silver darts and stainless steel darts are the ideal darts to throw.
	These darts are of lower quality than, for example, tungsten darts.
	The quality of the darts is not even so much in the life of the dart, but more in its functionality.
	You can compare the difference with the difference between a granny bike and a racing bike.
	With a granny's bike you can't cycle as fast as with a racing bike,
	Purely because racing bike is made for cycling fast and a granny's bike is made for getting from A to B.
	The same goes for the difference between brass darts and tungsten darts.
	With brass darts it seems that you can't play darts as well as with tungsten darts,
	Because the material doesn't allow you to throw as consistently and therefore you produce more deflections.
	The main difference between a brass dart and a tungsten dart is the thickness of the barrel.
	The barrel is the part of the dart where you hold your dart.
	Brass darts have a thicker barrel, which makes it difficult to group three darts into, for example, the triple 20.
	With tungsten darts, for example, this is a lot easier because the barrels are thinner.
 	This is of course better when you really want to play serious darts.
	If you think that brass darts, nickel silver darts or stainless steel darts are the right darts for you, you can find them here.
	</p2>
</pre>


<p1>The Beginning Darter</p1>
<br>
<pre>
	<p2>
	The beginning darter is more serious about darts than the recreational darter.
	The beginning darter wants to throw more often and become better at darts, but is not sure if he wants to do this for a longer period.
	If you want to get better at darts, it is better to start throwing with tungsten darts.
	However, there is a difference between tungsten darts. You have 95% tungsten darts, but also 70% tungsten darts.
	The percentage of tungsten means how many percent of the barrel consists of the material tungsten.
	Because tungsten is a heavy material, a barrel with a higher percentage of tungsten is thinner.
	You need less material to give the barrel of the dart the weight it needs.
	A 95% tungsten dart weighing 25 grams has a thinner barrel than a 70% tungsten dart weighing 25 grams.
	Again, the quality is not in the durability, but in the thickness of the barrel.
	With a 95% tungsten dart, you have a thinner shaft and you can group your darts more easily.
	Because darts is a sport where millimeters can make the difference, a thinner barrel can be the difference between winning and losing.
	With a thicker barrel you are more likely to throw your dart against the dart already in the board,
	Causing your dart to ricochet off the desired triple or double.
	For the beginning darter we recommend tungsten darts up to 80% tungsten, because tungsten darts with a higher percentage of tungsten are more expensive.
	If you are not sure whether you really want to become a frequent dart player, it is a shame to invest a lot of money in darts.
	Here you can find all darts with a tungsten percentage up to 80%.
	</p2>

<p1>The Experienced Darter</p1>

<pre>
	<p2>
	The experienced darter is a darter who is serious about darts, throws weekly, or participates in matches and competitions.
	In the previous paragraph we described the difference between the different percentages of tungsten darts.
 	If you want to play on a high level you need darts of 85% tungsten or more.
	The professional darts have darts of at least 90% tungsten.
	Here you can find all darts of 85% tungsten or more.
